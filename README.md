# Lower the Volume 🔉

A stealth speech jammer app that uses delayed auditory feedback to disrupt someone's ability to speak clearly.

## The Story

I was at Bombay airport. Some dude was watching reels on full volume and laughing loudly. Asking nicely doesn't work anymore. Me being me, didn't have the courage to speak up.

So I built a tiny app that plays back the same audio it hears, delayed by ~2 seconds. Asked Claude, it spat out a working version in one prompt. Surprisingly **WORKS**.

## The Science

When you speak, your brain relies on immediate auditory feedback (hearing your own voice) to regulate speech patterns. This is called the auditory feedback loop.

When your voice is played back to you with a delay of approximately 200-2000 milliseconds, it creates **Delayed Auditory Feedback (DAF)**. This disrupts the feedback loop your brain depends on, causing:

- Cognitive dissonance between what you're saying and what you're hearing
- Difficulty maintaining speech rhythm and fluency
- Involuntary slowing of speech rate
- Increased stuttering or complete speech disruption

This phenomenon has been studied since the 1950s and is actually used therapeutically to help people with stuttering disorders. In this app, it's weaponized for personal space protection.
